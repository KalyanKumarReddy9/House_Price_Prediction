ðŸ“Š XGBoost Regression Model
Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of XGBoost Regressor for predicting continuous values from a dataset. It utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn to perform data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python Libraries:

NumPy: For numerical operations

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning tasks (train-test split, model evaluation)

XGBoost: For building the regression model

Metrics: For evaluating the model performance (e.g., RMSE, MAE)

ðŸ“Š Overview
This project walks through the following steps:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Import a sample regression dataset from Scikit-Learn.

Visualize the data distribution and relationships between features using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Data Preprocessing:

Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training:

Train an XGBoost Regressor on the training set to predict the continuous target variable.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance using common regression metrics like RMSE and MAE.
